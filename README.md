=============================

Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The script called run_analysis.R takes a number of files from the Samsung data set accelerometer data. These files are then put together into one large data.frame containing all data. Two columns are added to this accelerometer data. One column with Subject, which is what person that was holding the handset when the accelermeter data was created. The other column contains the activity that the person performed.
